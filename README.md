## General Information

Lending Club is a consumer finance marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

Like most other lending companies, _lending loans to ‘risky’_ applicants is the largest source of financial loss _(called credit loss)_. The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

It specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.

In other words, **borrowers** who **default** cause the largest amount of **loss to the lenders**. In this case, the customers labelled as _'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'_.

The core objective of the excercise is to **help the company minimise the credit loss**. There are two potential sources of **credit loss** are:

- Applicant **likely to repay the loan**, such an applicant will bring in profit to the company with interest rates.** Rejecting such applicants will result in loss of business**.
- Applicant **not likely to repay** the loan, i.e. and will potentially default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss\* for the company
